    <note>1 map : col. ; 24 x 39 cm. Map is printed on rag linen paper and lined with a similar material on verso. There are small tears throughout the map, including two in the upper left hand corner which make the map's numbering illegible.</note>

  <note>"Scale 6chs = one inch." The map is oriented so that the top is west, with the directional arrow pointing to the right, which is north. Below the title is the surveyor's information: "Thos. A. Blyth. P.L.S. Hamilton, C.W. Octr 2nd 1862". The map's copy hand and the individual to whom the sketch was given are also listed: "Copied by D. Sheldon Smith. Brantford, C.W. 25/10/62", "To Sheriff Smith. Brantford, C.W." The map is numbered "Drawer No 1" in handwriting. The roads included on the map are "Original Road allowance" [now Sherman Avenue], "1st Concession" [now Barton Street], and an unnamed road at the southern end of the map. The names of two property owners are mentioned on the map: "Lottridge" and "Case". An inlet of the shoreline is shown to reach well into the city.</note>
