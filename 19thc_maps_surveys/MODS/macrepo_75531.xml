According to an article entitled, "Vanished Hamilton: A litany of loss", in the Hamilton Spectator (Feb. 17, 2013), "the cornerstone of the Crystal Palace was laid in 1860, in preparation for Hamilton to play host to the Provincial Exhibition (which evolved into the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE)). The building was key to the development of the cityâ€™s west end.... In 1891, the Crystal Palace and its building were auctioned off to the public." "32" is handwritten in pencil near the top of the sheet.</note>
